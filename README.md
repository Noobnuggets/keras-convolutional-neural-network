# keras-convolutional-neural-network
Simple implementation of a convolutional neural network(CNN), trained and tested on the MNIST dataset with a testing accuracy of <b>98%-99%</b><br>
The problem presented to the CNN is to categorise an image with a handwritten digit. <br>The neural nets output is limited to 0-9.
